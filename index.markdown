Hello, I'm Aravinth.

I find computers fascinating and making them do a certain thing a
certain way even more fascinating. So I spend most of my time building
and breaking software.

### Contact
You can find me on the [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@realaravinth:matrix.batsense.net),

### Disclosure

We live in an era where computers and the internet have become an
extension of our lives, if not a second one. The Evil Corps of our era
take advantage of this and this is so prevalent that it has become the
industry standard. Monitization now comes at he cost users' privacy.
And the amount of data that I have these organisations collect in exchange
for services annoy the Cyherpunk in me.
